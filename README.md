# SPACESHIP
Spaceship game

This game was developed during the Coursera course "An Introduction to Python", by Rice University.
Unfortunately I did not know about Github around that time.

With the intention to start using git/GitHub actively from now on, the game was uploaded.
A new branch was created to fix a few minor bugs (see first commits). Tests were performed and meanwhile the branch was pushed (just in case the tests took long, days, etc). Once changes were validated, branch was merged into main and pushed upstream.
