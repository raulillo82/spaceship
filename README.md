# SPACESHIP
Spaceship game

This game was developed during the Coursera course "An Introduction to Python", by Rice University.
Unfortunately I did not know about Github around that time.

With the intention to start using git/GitHub actively from now on, the game was uploaded.
In addition, some minor errors were found and commented out, I will try to fix them with some time and commit any changes, seizing the opportunity to use both git/GitHub and Python
